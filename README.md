# Reasoning-based-LLM-Editing
Source code and data for CSE 598 Project

Note that all of our experiments are actually strongly based on the baseline method repositories, so we attached the link to our forked and edited baseline repos here: 
- Data generation and benchmarking experiments: https://github.com/rjs0/rome_edit.
- More testing codes on data generation, pilot study, and benchmarking experiments: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3gmxjqx58mxvtp3p7kzg7/rome.zip?rlkey=ez3tszzsylz90nq77jdtakz3e&st=0ie7k2ik&dl=0
  (This contains the original CounterFact dataset and other existing datasets, although not used.)
